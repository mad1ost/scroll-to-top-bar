# Scroll to top bar

Add scroll to top bar when hovering over a scrollbar of the page.

Click on the "scroll to top bar" and you will be moved to the top of the page; click on it again and you will be moved to the previous scroll position. See also extension preferences.

To install manually, rename the corresponding file (`manifest.chrome.json` for Chrome, `manifest.firefox.json` for Firefox) to `manifest.json`.
